# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using Java programming language and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) core concepts.

Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Any IDE that supports Java (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

How to run the game?
Clone this repository or download the source code
Open the project in your favorite IDE
Compile and run the TicTacToe.java file

Game Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 grid
There are two players in the game: Player 1 and Player 2
Player 1 is assigned "X" symbol and Player 2 is assigned "O" symbol
The players take turns to place their symbols on the grid
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game
If all the cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw

Implementation Details
Classes
TicTacToe
This is the main class of the game that handles the game flow. It has the following responsibilities:

Initializes the game board
Manages the game loop
Gets player input and validates it
Checks if there is a winner or if the game has ended in a draw
Prints the game board after every turn
Player
This class represents a player in the game. It has the following attributes:

name: the name of the player
symbol: the symbol assigned to the player ("X" or "O")
Board
This class represents the game board. It has the following attributes:

board: a 3x3 array that holds the state of the game board
OOPs Concepts
Encapsulation
The Player class encapsulates the name and symbol attributes, which are private and can only be accessed through public getter and setter methods.

Inheritance
There is no inheritance used in this implementation.

Polymorphism
There is no polymorphism used in this implementation.

Abstraction
The Board class abstracts the game board details and provides public methods to interact with the board. The TicTacToe class interacts with the board using these public methods without knowing the details of how the board works.

Conclusion
This is a simple implementation of Tic Tac Toe game using Java programming language and OOPs core concepts. It can be improved by adding more features, such as a graphical user interface, difficulty levels, and multiplayer mode.
